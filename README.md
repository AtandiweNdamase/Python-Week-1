# Python-Week-1
Python Intro courses on LMs : DATA TYEPS
variables , classes , interger, boolens , decimals, 
Run some python code 
declared classes to group obejcts of the same type
Did some quizes module 1 of basic data types
Integers and floats the difference between them and how to round off decimals(floats)
Python automatically returns a float to accomodate whole numbers
20/4 = 5.0
adding, multiplying and using exponents flots to an int aso returns a float
Casting is converting from one built in class(int, float, list) to another
When casting a floats to ints Python does not round off it removes the decimal alone
eg. int(8.9 ) = 8 , to round off a float we use round(8.9) = 9
Alyernative numbers 
if you pass a numb er as string it will be returned as a interger
"200" = 200
getcontext.prec(2)
Decimal(1)/ Decimal(3) 
this will round off to two decimal places
Anything that is not 0 is true for a boolean , and 0 is false
an empty string is flase , a string false is true 
Slicing through strings and lists has the same method
 name = "My name is Iron man"
 name[0] returns 'M' the programe starts counting from zero
 Bytes is passed around data that works behind the scenes stored as 1 and 0
when we spot a b' infront of something printed out it is a bytes
Hexadecimals base 16 , 
Modifying Lists by using 'apend' which adds value to list
A set is defined with curly brackets {'1', '2','3'} sets only contain unique values and can be used to remove dulplicates.
Dictionaries and Lists are the two main data structures
List Comprehensions , the comrehensive listing of things, mltiple ites in a list by a value enables you to Filter your list
